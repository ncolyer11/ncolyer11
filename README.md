## What I Do

- **Technical Minecraft Development**: I develop tools and utilities that aid in the development process for technical Minecraft projects such as nether tree and chorus plant farms
- **Educational Content Creation**: I leverage my passion for engineering and computer science to teach others about programming and technical Minecraft through coding up animations using Manim
